// The people who buy ads on our network don't have enough data about how ads are working for
//their business. They've asked us to find out which ads produce the most purchases on their website.

// Our client provided us with a list of user IDs of customers who bought something on a landing page
//after clicking one of their ads:

 # Each user completed 1 purchase.
 completed_purchase_user_ids = [
   "3123122444","234111110", "8321125440", "99911063"]

 And our ops team provided us with some raw log data from our ad server showing every time a
user clicked on one of our ads:
 ad_clicks = [
  # "IP_Address,Time,Ad_Text",
  "122.121.0.1,2016-11-03 11:41:19,Buy wool coats for your pets",
  "96.3.199.11,2016-10-15 20:18:31,2017 Pet Mittens",
  "122.121.0.250,2016-11-01 06:13:13,The Best Hollywood Coats",
  "82.1.106.8,2016-11-12 23:05:14,Buy wool coats for your pets",
  "92.130.6.144,2017-01-01 03:18:55,Buy wool coats for your pets",
  "92.130.6.145,2017-01-01 03:18:55,2017 Pet Mittens",
]

//The client also sent over the IP addresses of all their users.

all_user_ips = [
  # "User_ID,IP_Address",
